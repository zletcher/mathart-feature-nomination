## ✨ What is MathArt Playground?

**MathArt Playground** is a free iOS app that helps learners visualize and create vibrant geometric art while intuitively engaging with core math concepts like symmetry, rotation, and transformation.

Originally built as a year-long capstone project, the app is now live on the App Store and used by classrooms to inspire open-ended visual learning.
